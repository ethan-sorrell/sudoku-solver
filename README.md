# sudoku-solver

First time making a webapp in clojure.
Practice for upcoming projects

## Usage

```
lein run [port-number]
```
You will see the input page:  
![Input page](./img/input_demo.jpg)  
Clicking solve will bring you to:  
![Output page](./img/output_demo.jpg)  

Currently the solver uses brute-force. A more sophisticated implementation may come in the future.
